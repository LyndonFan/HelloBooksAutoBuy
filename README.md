# HelloBooksAutoBuy
Buying books recommended in email automatically from Amazon.

## About
[Hello Books](https://www.hellobooks.com) is a free subscription service that regularly sends links for you to buy eBooks for free from Amazon. I wanted to create something that could click through the numerous (~40) links automatically instead of me spending 15 minutes per weekend, so I spent much more time to automate this process.

## Prerequesites
- subscribed to the service
- amazon account
- credentials to gmail api
- selenium (the library)
- chromedriver (for selenium)

## Usage
- TODO

## TODO
- test the integrated product (only tried it by running scripts one by one, but not all at once. Maybe next weekend?)
